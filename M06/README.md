Assignment:

1: Write a GUI program that converts Celsius temperatures to Fahrenheit temperatures. The user should be able to enter a Celsius temperature, click a button, then see the equivalent Fahrenheit temperature. Use the following formula to make the conversion(30 points):

F = 9/5 * C + 32

F is the Fahrenheit temperature, and C is the Celsius temperature.

You should sallow the user to enter a generic temperature, and have two buttons -- one to treat the input as Fahrenheit and convert it to Celsius; and one to treat the input as Celsius and convert it to Fahrenheit.

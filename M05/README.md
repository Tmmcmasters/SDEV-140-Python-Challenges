**1:** A retail company must file a monthly sales tax report listing the total sales for the month, and the amount of state and county sales tax collected. The state sales tax rate is 5 percent and the county sales tax rate is 2.5 percent. Write a function that asks the user to enter the total sales for the month. From this figure, the application should calculate and display the following (15 points):

The amount of county sales tax

The amount of state sales tax

The total sales tax (county plus state)

**2:** Write a function that generates a random number in the range of 1 through 100, and asks the user to guess what the number is. If the user’s guess is higher than the random number, the program should display “Too high, try again.” If the user’s guess is lower than the random number, the program should display “Too low, try again.” If the user guesses the number, the application should congratulate the user and generate a new random number so the game can start over (15 points).
